# Grand Canyon University Java Certificate Program
# Trip Booking Exercise (SQL)

## Second GitHub Exercise
Building applications without some form of data persistance becomes old very quickly.  As the programmer you need to test your application.  When the program uses information the user enters, the programmer many times gets stuck entering information repeatedly.  Once a developer learns data persistance through file read/write or through SQL the testing moves to a more real-world experience.  To help grow as a DB and Java programmer, this exercise creates a foundation for playing with the interaction between Java and SQL using JDBC.  The project is about booking a boat tour.  The customers and the boats will be stored in a DB and the Java will perform the CRUD operations of Create=INSERT, Read=SELECT, Update=UPDATE, and Delete=DELETE.  The code on Github included the SQL scripts to make and rebuid the DB when you mess it up. 

This program and code can be used to grow your programming and database experience.  The code has the foundation to allow you to experiment with more advanced Java and mySQL ideas.  Don't worry if you screw something up because you can make a new pull request and get the original code back. To further advance your marketable software development skills, fork the repository, and then create your enhancements locally.  Once you are satisfied, push then to your forked version and create your baseline code.
